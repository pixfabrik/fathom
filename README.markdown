# Fathom

We're not hosting the source for [Fathom](http://www.letsfathom.com) here, but we wanted to be able to share our bug database publicly and github seemed like the best place. Please head over to the [Issues](https://github.com/pixfabrik/fathom/issues). 

Note: Fathom is currently broken due to Rdio going out of service. We're working on a new version with a [different UI](http://letsfathom/com/v2) and new features. Stay tuned!
